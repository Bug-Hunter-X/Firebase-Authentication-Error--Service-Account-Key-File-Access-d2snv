The solution often involves verifying several factors:

1. **Correct File Path:** Double-check that the path to `serviceAccountKey.json` in `require('./path/to/serviceAccountKey.json');` is absolutely correct.  Use absolute paths to avoid ambiguity.

2. **File Permissions:** Ensure the Node.js process has read access to the serviceAccountKey.json file.  Incorrect permissions can prevent the application from reading the key file.

3. **File Contents:** Verify that `serviceAccountKey.json` is a valid JSON file and contains the correct service account credentials.  Any syntax error in this file will cause the error.

4. **Correct Project ID:** Make sure the `databaseURL` is correctly configured for your Firebase project.

5. **Environment Variables:** Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information like the key file path instead of hardcoding them in your source code. This improves security and maintainability.

Here's an example of a corrected version in `bugSolution.js`:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const path = require('path');

const serviceAccountPath = path.join(__dirname, 'serviceAccountKey.json'); // Use absolute path

const serviceAccount = require(serviceAccountPath);

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: "https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com"
});

// ... further database operations
```

Remember to replace `your-project-id` with your actual Firebase project ID.
